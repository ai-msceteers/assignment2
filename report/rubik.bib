  abstract     = {The Rubik's Cube is perhaps the world's most famous and iconic
                  puzzle, well-known to have a rich underlying mathematical
                  structure (group theory). In this paper, we show that the
                  Rubik's Cube also has a rich underlying algorithmic
                  structure. Specifically, we show that the n {\texttimes}n
                  {\texttimes}n Rubik's Cube, as well as the n {\texttimes}n
                  {\texttimes}1 variant, has a ``God's Number'' (diameter of the
                  configuration space) of $\Theta$(n2/logn). The upper bound
                  comes from effectively parallelizing standard $\Theta$(n2)
                  solution algorithms, while the lower bound follows from a
                  counting argument. The upper bound gives an asymptotically
                  optimal algorithm for solving a general Rubik's Cube in the
                  worst case. Given a specific starting state, we show how to
                  find the shortest solution in an n {\texttimes}O(1)
                  {\texttimes}O(1) Rubik's Cube. Finally, we show that finding
                  this optimal solution becomes NP-hard in an n {\texttimes}n
                  {\texttimes}1 Rubik's Cube when the positions and colors of
                  some cubies are ignored (not used in determining whether the
                  cube is solved).},

                  of Rubik's Cube. The median optimal solution length appears to
                  be 18 moves. The algorithm used is iterative-deepening-A*
                  (IDA*), with a lower-bound heuristic function based on large
                  memory-based lookup tables, or "pattern databases" (Culberson
                  and Schaeffer 1996). These tables store the exact number of
                  moves required to solve various subgoals of the problem, in
                  this case subsets of the individual movable cubies. We
                  characterize the effectiveness of an admissible heuristic
                  function by its expected value, and hypothesize that the
                  overall performance of the program obeys a relation in which
                  the product of the time and space used equals the size of the
                  state space. Thus, the speed of the program increases linearly
                  with the amount of memory available. As computer memories
                  become larger and cheaper, we believe that this approach will
                  become increasingly cost-effective.},

                  or fewer, where a move is defined as any twist of any
                  face. The roughly $4.3 \times 10^{19}$ positions are
                  partitioned into about two billion cosets of a specially
                  chosen subgroup, and the count of cosets required to be
                  treated is reduced by considering symmetry. The reduced space
                  is searched with a program capable of solving one billion
                  positions per second, using about one billion seconds of CPU
                  time donated by Google. As a byproduct of determining that the
