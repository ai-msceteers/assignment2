- Everyone present.
- Fionntán looked into parameters of the assignment.
- Talha, Will, and Basil found relatively recent papers on a few different
  puzzles/games.
- Will came across Arcade Learning Environment AI research framework.

- Consensus for simple but interesting enough games/puzzles.
  + Considered:
    - Adversarial snakebattle
    - Travelling salesman
    - OpenGym - Mario
    - Rubik's Cube
    - 2048
    - Minesweeper
- Converged on looking initially into Rubik's.
  + There seems to be recent enough literature:
    - Genetic algorithms
    - Simulated annealing
    - Reinforcement learning
    - [CSP?]

- Meet again next week, with intention of having most of an implementation of a
  different approach by then, so that there is time for evaluation and writeup.
  + Talha to look into genetic algorithms.
  + Fionntán to look into simulated annealing.
  + Will & Basil to look into reinforcement learning.
  + Everyone to look into evaluation environments.
